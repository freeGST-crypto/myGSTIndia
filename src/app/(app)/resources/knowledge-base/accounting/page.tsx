          <p>The Chart of Accounts is the backbone of your accounting system. It is a complete list of every financial account in your general ledger. In GSTEase, these accounts are organized into five main categories: Assets, Liabilities, Equity, Revenue, and Expenses.</p>
          <p>You can view the standard list of accounts and also add your own custom accounts for specific business needs.</p>

        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none">
          <p>Journal Vouchers are used to record manual accounting entries that don't fit into the standard sales or purchase workflows. This is where you can make adjustments, record accruals, book depreciation, or correct errors.</p>
          <h4>Key Principles:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Double-Entry System:</strong> Every journal entry must have equal debits and credits. The form will not allow you to save an unbalanced entry.</li>
            <li><strong>Narration:</strong> Always provide a clear and concise narration for every entry. This explains the "why" behind the transaction and is crucial for audits and future reference.</li>
            <li><strong>Reversals:</strong> To maintain a clear audit trail, GSTEase doesn't allow direct deletion of entries. Instead, you can "Reverse" an entry, which creates a new journal voucher that cancels out the original one.</li>
          </ul>

            <p>The General Ledger provides a detailed, chronological history of all transactions for a specific account.
